/**
 * Per-card FSRS engine wrapper (design §7, §13).
 *
 * This is the single place the app touches `ts-fsrs` (MIT). FSRS models
 * **stability, difficulty, and retrievability as independent axes**, so a card
 * the learner recalls easily but that is intrinsically hard is no longer
 * conflated the way SM-2's single `ease` number forces. There is NO topic-level
 * SM-2 here — scheduling is per card.
 *
 * The functions are pure (state in → patch out) and DB-free, so they unit-test
 * in any Node ≥ 18 without a native SQLite binding. Fuzz is disabled so the
 * schedule is deterministic and testable.
